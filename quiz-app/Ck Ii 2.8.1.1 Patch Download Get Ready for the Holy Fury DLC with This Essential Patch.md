You can also collect wondrous new Chinese artifacts for your characters, and explore a new Silk Road system that adjusts returns based on China's stability.
 
Jade Dragon also introduces new religions, such as BÃ¶n, Taoism, and Khurmazta, as well as new cultures, portraits, and units for the Tibetan region. It also adds eight new casus belli options for declaring war, such as Force Vassalization, Border Dispute, and Trade War. Additionally, it adds a new "China Screen" that shows the status and desires of the Emperor of China, as well as a new "Rally Points" feature that lets you instruct your levies to automatically gather up where you want them.
 
## Why should you play Jade Dragon DLC?
